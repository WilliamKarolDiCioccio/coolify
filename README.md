# Uncoolify - A Fun AI Text Experiment

This isn't a tool to be taken seriously but rather a playful proof of concept to make AI-generated text feel more human by adding random typos. Inspired by this video, the idea is simple: take perfectly generated text and introduce small imperfections. The idea is that in this age of technology aided perfection it can sometimes be cool to see some small errors hinting that huamn hand might be behind it. The videos explains it thoroughly. In the future I'll make the UI prettier and add other kinds of common human generated mistakes ðŸ˜„
